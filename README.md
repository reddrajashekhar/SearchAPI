# searchAPI:
*    Write a test plan for the documented [iTunes Search API](https://github.com/iappsqainterview/searchAPI/blob/master/API.md)
  
Introduction:
        The test plan is the document that is written by reviewing requirement documents
	The test plan consists of scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended 
	testing activities.It identifies test items, the features to be tested, the testing
	tasks and who will do each task(roles and responsibilities) and any risks and its 
	solutions.
Objective:
        The webpage consists of ITunes store, App store, i Books store, Mac App store. By 
	using the Search API one can search fields in the website.One can search for variety of
	content ie,.Movies,Podcasts, Music, App store, Audio Books, and Tv Shows.

	The first step in this project will be like like creating manual tests. The API testing.
	The team members in the project are as follows:

Team Members:
        ResourceName               Role
	1.Greg John              Developer
	2.Michael                Project Manager
	3.Rajashekhar            Tester

Scope:
        The Scope of this project include all the requiremnts.All the requiremnts should be included 
	and all the requirements should be tested.By the end of all the tests one has to cover all 
	the following :
	    1.Review the test plan and create the manual test and it has to include every step
	    2.All the test documents should be saved for future reference
	    3.The document should be available when running the tests
	    4.enter results and appropriate comments
	    5.View Results
Assumptions:
        A fully -qualified  URL to search must on the project are identified and action to mitigate
	this impact should be mentioned in the project.The project is based on Agile methodology with 
	bi-weekly iteartions.In every two weeks, the module which is developed will be delivered to
	team and will be tested.

	This projects mainly includes exploratory testing and end-to-end testing and team
	tests the whole system by using various tools.Tests for planned functionality will be craeated
	and added to iTunes Search API as we get iterations of the product.

	4.1 Test Automation testing is a part of the process.At the starting of the process manual
	testing plays a key role and automation testing is done with the manual testing.
