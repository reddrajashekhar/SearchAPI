Introduction 
      The test plan is the document that is written by reviewing requirement documents. The test plan consists of scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended testing activities. It identifies test items, the features to be tested, the testing tasks and who will do each task (roles and responsibilities) and any risks and its solutions.
Objective:
The webpage consists of ITunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store and Mac App Store. By using the Search API one can search fields in the website. On can search for variety of content ie,. Movies, podacasts, music, Mac App Store, audio books, and Tv shows.

The first step in this project will be like creating manual tests. The API testing is sending request and receiving response.The team members in the project are as follows:

Scope
The scope of this project include all the requirements. All the requirements should be included and all the requirements should be tested.By the end of all the tests one has to cover all the following:
1.Reviewing the test plan and create the manual test and it has to include every step.
2.All the test documents should be saved for future reference
3.The document should be available when running the tests.
4.Enter results and appropriate comments
5.View results



ssumptions / Risks
Assumptions
A fully-qualified URL to search must have the following format:
https://itunes.apple.com/search?parameterkeyvalue
Risks
The risks that will have impact on the project are identified and action to mitigate this impact should be mentioned in the project.
Test Approach
The project is based on Agile methodology with Bi-weekly iterations. In every two weeks, the module which is developed will be delivered to team and will be tested.

This projects mainly includes exploratory testing and end-to-end testing and team tests the whole system by using various tools.Tests for planned functionality will be created and added to iTunes Search API as we get iterations of the product.

4.1 Test Automation
             Automated testing is a part of the process. At the starting of the process manual testing plays a key role and automation testing is done once done with the manual testing.
